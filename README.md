This is my personal engineering journal where I document my daily hands-on practice with different technologies. Each day represents focused learning on a specific topic, building real projects to solidify concepts. 

I created this repo to track my consistent growth as an engineer and to build in public. Instead of scattered day-wise repositories, this serves as a central index linking all my daily work - making it easy to see my progress and learning path over time.
